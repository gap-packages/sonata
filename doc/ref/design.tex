Although the functions described in this section were initially meant to
investigate designs generated from nearrings, they can also be applied to
other incidence structures. In principal a design is represented as a set
of points and a set of blocks, a subset of the powerset of the points, with
containment as incidence relation.

\>DesignFromPointsAndBlocks( <points>, <blocks> )

`DesignFromPointsAndBlocks' returns the design with the set of points 
<points> and the set of blocks <blocks>, a subset of the powerset of 
<points>.

\>DesignFromIncidenceMat( M );

`DesignFromIncidenceMat' returns the design with incidence matrix <M>,
The rows of <M> are labelled by the set of points $1$ to $v$, the
columns represent the blocks.
If the $( i, j )$ entry of the matrix <M> is $1$, then the point $i$ is 
incident with the $j$-th block, i.e. the $j$-th block consists of those
points $i$ for which the entry $( i, j )$ of <M> is $1$. All other entries 
have to be $0$.

\>DesignFromPlanarNearRing( <N>, <type> )

`DesignFromPlanarNearRing' returns a design obtained from the planar 
nearring <N> following the constructions of James R. Clay
\cite{Clay:Nearrings}.

If <type> = `"*"', `DesignFromPlanarNearRing' returns the design 
$(<N>,B^{*},\in)$ in the notation of J. R. Clay with the elements of <N> as 
set of points and $\{N^{*}\cdot a+b | a,b\in N, a \not= 0 \}$ as set of blocks.
Here $N^{*}$ is the set of elements $x\in N$ satisfying $x\cdot N = N$.

If <type> = `" "' (blank), `DesignFromPlanarNearRing' returns the design 
$(<N>,B,\in)$ in the notation of J. R. Clay with the elements of <N> as 
set of points and $\{N\cdot a+b | a,b\in N, a \not= 0 \}$ as set of 
blocks.

\>DesignFromFerreroPair( <G>, <phi>, <type> )

`DesignFromFerreroPair' returns a design obtained from the group <G>, and
a group of fixed-point-free automorphisms <phi> acting on <G> following the
constructions of James R. Clay \cite{Clay:Nearrings}.

If <type> = `"*"', `DesignFromFerreroPair' returns the design 
$(<G>,B^{*},\in)$ in the notation of J. R. Clay with the elements of <G> as 
set of points and the nonzero orbits of <G> under <phi> and their 
translates by group-elements as set of blocks.

If <type> = `" "' (blank), `DesignFromFerreroPair' returns the design 
$(<G>,B,\in)$ in the notation of J. R. Clay with the elements of <G> as 
set of points and the nonzero orbits of <G> under <phi> joined with the zero
of <G> and their translates by group-elements as set of blocks.

\>DesignFromWdNearRing( <N> )

`DesignFromWdNearring' returns a design obtained from the weakly divisible 
nearring <N> with cyclic additive group of prime power order. Following the
constructions of A. Benini, F. Morini and S. Pellegrini, we take the elements
of <N> as set of points and $\{N\cdot a+b | a\in C, b\in <N>\}$ as set of
blocks. Here $C$ is the set of elements $a\in N$ such that $a\cdot N = N$.

\>PointsOfDesign( <D> )

`PointsOfDesign' returns the actual list of points of the design <D>, not
their positions, no matter how the points of the design <D> may be 
represented. To get the representation of those points, whose positions in 
the list of all points are given by the list <pointnrs>, one can use
`PointsOfDesign( <D> )\{<pointnrs>\}'.

\endexample

\>BlocksOfDesign( <D> )

`BlocksOfDesign' returns the actual list of blocks of the design <D>, not
their positions. Blocks are represented as lists of points. A point is 
incident with a block if the point is an element of the 
block. To get the representation of those blocks, whose positions in 
the list of all blocks are given by the list <blocknrs>, one can use
`BlocksOfDesign( <D> )\{<blocknrs>\}'.

\endexample

\>DesignParameter( <D> )

`DesignParameter' returns the set of paramaters $t, v, b, r, k, \lambda$ 
of the design <D>. Here $v$ is the size of the set of points 
`PointsOfDesign', $b$ is the size of the set of blocks `PointsOfDesign',
every point is incident with precisely $r$ blocks, every block is incident 
with precisely $k$ points, every $t$ distinct points are together incident
with precisely $\lambda$ blocks.

\endexample

\>IncidenceMat( <D> )

`IncidenceMat' returns the incidence matrix of the design <D>, where the
rows are labelled by the positions of the points in `PointsOfDesign', the
columns are labelled by the positions of the blocks in `BlocksOfDesign'.
If the point in position $i$ is incident with the block in position $j$, then
the $( i, j )$ entry of the matrix `IncidenceMat' is $1$, else it is $0$.

\beginexample
    gap> M1 := IncidenceMat( D1 );
    [ [ 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1 ],

\endexample

\>PrintIncidenceMat( <D> )

`PrintIncidenceMat' prints only the entries of the incidence matrix 
`IncidenceMat' of the design without commas. If the point in position $i$ is 
incident with the block in position $j$, then there is $1$ in the $i$-th
row, $j$-th column, else there is '.', a dot.

\>BlockIntersectionNumbers( <D> )
\>BlockIntersectionNumbersK( <D>, <blocknr> )

In the first form `BlockIntersectionNumbers' returns the list of 
cardinalities of the intersection of each block with all other blocks of the
design <D>.
In the second form `BlockIntersectionNumbers' returns the list of 
cardinalities of the intersection of the block in position <blocknr>  with 
all other blocks of the design <D>. 

\beginexample
    gap> BlockIntersectionNumbers( D1, 2 );
    [ 0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1 ]
    gap> # the second has empty intersection with the first block
    gap> # and intersects all others in at most 2 points
\endexample

\>IsCircularDesign( <D> )

`IsCircularDesign' returns `true' if the design <D> is circular and `false'
otherwise. The design <D> has to be the result of `DesignFromPlanarNearRing'
or `DesignFromFerreroPair', since `IsCircularDesign' assumes the particular
structure of such a nearring-generated design. 

A design <D> is *circular* if every two distinct blocks intersect in at most
two points.
% CLAY'S DEFINITION IS TOO STRICT:
% every three distinct points of <D> are incident with at most one block and
% every two distinct points of <D> are incident with at least two distinct blocks.

`IsCircularDesign' calls the function `BlockIntersectionNumbers'.  

\beginexample 
    gap> IsCircularDesign( D1 );
    true

whose position in the list `BlocksOfDesign( <D> )' is given by <blocknr>, 
that is, the point is contained in the block as an element in a set.
